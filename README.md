# DOCKERLAND

A collection of Docker/Podman/Packer, Docker-Compose and Kubernetes configuration files as a reference.

## LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES
- **Apache Airflow** is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.
- **Apache Amundsen**: a data discovery and metadata engine for improving the productivity of data analysts, data scientists and engineers when interacting with data.
- **Apache Atlas** is a scalable and extensible set of core foundational governance services â€“ enabling enterprises to effectively and efficiently meet their compliance requirements within Hadoop and allows integration with the whole enterprise data ecosystem.
- **Apache Cassandra** is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
- **Apache Flink** is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.
- **Apache Hadoop** is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.
- **Apache HBase** is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.
- **Apache Hive** is a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale and facilitates reading, writing, and managing petabytes of data residing in distributed storage using SQL.
- **Apache Hudi** is a transactional data lake platform that brings database and data warehouse capabilities to the data lake. Hudi reimagines slow old-school batch data processing with a powerful new incremental processing framework for low latency minute-level analytics.
- **Apache Kafka** is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.
- **Apache Pulsar** is an open-source, distributed messaging and streaming platform built for the cloud.
- **Apache Solr** is the popular, blazing-fast, open source enterprise search platform built on Apache Lucene.
- **Apache Spark** is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
- **MinIO**  is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It is software-defined and runs on any cloud or on-premises infrastructure. MinIO is dual-licensed under open source GNU AGPL v3 and a commercial enterprise license.
