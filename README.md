A collection of Docker/Podman/Packer, Docker-Compose and Kubernetes configuration files as a reference.

## LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES

- **Apache Airflow** is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.
- **Apache Amundsen**: a data discovery and metadata engine for improving the productivity of data analysts, data scientists and engineers when interacting with data.
- **Apache Atlas** is a scalable and extensible set of core foundational governance services – enabling enterprises to effectively and efficiently meet their compliance requirements within Hadoop and allows integration with the whole enterprise data ecosystem.
- **Apache Cassandra** is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
- **Apache Flink** is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.
- **Apache Hadoop** is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.
- **Apache HBase** is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.
- **Apache Hive** is a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale and facilitates reading, writing, and managing petabytes of data residing in distributed storage using SQL.
- **Apache Hudi** is a transactional data lake platform that brings database and data warehouse capabilities to the data lake. Hudi reimagines slow old-school batch data processing with a powerful new incremental processing framework for low latency minute-level analytics.
- **Apache Kafka** is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.
- **Apache Pulsar** is an open-source, distributed messaging and streaming platform built for the cloud.
- **Apache Solr** is the popular, blazing-fast, open source enterprise search platform built on Apache Lucene.
- **Apache Spark** is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
- **Apache Superset** is an open-source modern data exploration and visualization platform.
- **CockroachDB** is a cloud native, distributed SQL database designed for high availability, effortless scale, and control over data placement.
- **Databricks** is a global data, analytics and artificial intelligence company founded by the original creators of Apache Spark. The company provides a cloud-based platform to help enterprises build, scale, and govern data and AI, including generative AI and other machine learning models.
- **Delta-Lake** is an open-source storage framework that enables building a format agnostic Lakehouse architecture with compute engines including Spark, PrestoDB, Flink, Trino, Hive, Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Athena, Redshift, Databricks, Azure Fabric and APIs for Scala, Java, Rust, and Python.
- **Elasticsearch** is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.
- **Hashicorp Terraform** is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. Terraform can manage both existing service providers and custom in-house solutions.
- **InfluxDB** is the open source time series database built for real-time analytic workloads.
- **Hashicorp Vault** is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.
- **Kong** is the world’s most adopted API gateway. Lightweight, fast, and flexible, this open source gateway is built for hybrid and multi-cloud and optimized for microservices and distributed architectures.
- **MinIO**  is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It is software-defined and runs on any cloud or on-premises infrastructure. MinIO is dual-licensed under open source GNU AGPL v3 and a commercial enterprise license.
- **MLFlow** is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. MLflow offers a set of lightweight APIs that can be used with any existing machine learning application or library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc), wherever you currently run ML code (e.g. in notebooks, standalone applications or the cloud).
- **MongoDB** is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- **Neoj4** is a graph database management system developed by Neo4j, Inc. The data elements Neo4j stores are nodes, edges connecting them, and attributes of nodes and edges.
- **Nginx** is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server.
- **PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- **RabbitMQ** is a reliable and mature messaging and streaming broker, which is easy to deploy on cloud environments, on-premises, and on your local machine. It is currently used by millions worldwide.
- **Redis** is a source-available, in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.
- **Sonarqube** is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality.
- **Traefik API** is a cloud-native, GitOps-driven API runtime solutions for demanding DevOps and Platform Engineers with diverse use-cases, environments, and deployment models.
