# API GATEWAY

**API Gateway/Management** is the process of creating and publishing web application programming interfaces, enforcing their usage policies, controlling access, nurturing the subscriber community, collecting and analyzing usage statistics, and reporting on performance.

## GETTING STARTED

An API Gateway/Management is composed:
- API Gateway
- Metadata database
- Cache fast-database
- Logging analysis solution

This solution is based on:

- [**Kong**](https://konghq.com/) is the world’s most adopted API gateway. Lightweight, fast, and flexible, this open source gateway is built for hybrid and multi-cloud and optimized for microservices and distributed architectures.

- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

- [**Redis**](https://redis.io/) is a source-available, in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.

- [**Elasticsearch**](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.
